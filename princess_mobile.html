        <div class="pp1"><p>This is my high school graduation picture. I graduated from Sinmok High School in Mokdong, Seoul. When I see myself smiling like this, I want to go back to this time. I think this picture contains both school days and feelings.</p></div> <!------pp1 end----->

        <p>This is a picture taken when I was a yellow hair. Ever since I was young, I wanted to do my bright yellow hair when I became a college student. It's pretty when I bleach my hair, but it's hard to manage and I care when I go to a polite place. Maybe I won't do it again. Sometimes I feel the urge to be bright again, but this is probably the last time.

        <p>I really like the stage where I can take pretty pictures. This is the Picture Zone in Lotte World. I went there with my high school friends in 2018, and I can't forget my memories here because I had so much fun. I hope my friendship with them will last forever. Oh, but that teddy bear was a little dirty, so I was sad..

        <p>This was when I went to Sokcho in February 2019. I've been to Sokcho three times in 2019. I took this picture with my friends on a trip. Of the three times I went, this was the coldest time.
Can you see that dynamic figure of the wind blowing my hair? I can still see the feeling of the biting wind in this picture.

        <p>I was a dancer for the Korean dance team 'Harang'.
The clothes worn during the performance are a modern adaptation of Korean traditional clothes.
I bought and made this cloth by myself.
I am now busy with other things, so I am stopping for a while, but if I have time, I will definitely do Korean dance again.

        <p>Here I am under a big cherry tree in the Han River.
At this time I was a freshman in college, full of joy, and knew how to make a big, big smile with new and fresh energy.<br/> 
                This picture shows not only my smile but also the spring of 2018.
Warm sunshine, lively spring breeze, and flying petals were such a romantic day
